### What problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solves?

Both this standards implement additional hooks to the token receiver. This allows avoid ERC20 approve-transfer flow, since with hooks sender could execute functions on the receiver contract. It also could be used to notify receiver about executed transfer.

### Why was ERC1363 introduced, and what issues are there with ERC777?

ERC777 require the execution of the tokensReceived hook for each transfer. Contracts interacting with ERC777 tokens must therefore implement additional security measures. However, these can introduce potential vulnerabilities, and be not gas-efficient. In contrast, ERC1363 allows using standard ERC20 transfers without the obligatory use of hooks.
